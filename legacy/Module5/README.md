# Module5 â€” Functions Toolkit

## Learning Focus
- Build reusable functions with clear signatures and docstrings.
- Understand Python's scope rules, especially `global` versus local variables.
- Apply lambda expressions for concise inline behavior.

## Materials
- `5-1_function.ipynb`: Introduces function definitions, parameters, return values.
- `5-2_global.ipynb`: Demonstrates scope resolution, `global` keyword practices, and common pitfalls.
- `5-3_lambda.ipynb`: Explores anonymous functions, higher-order applications, and practical examples.

## Practice Ideas
- Refactor repetitive code from earlier modules into dedicated functions.
- Experiment with default parameters and keyword arguments to improve API clarity.
- Combine lambdas with built-ins such as `map`, `filter`, and `sorted` to streamline data workflows.

## Next Steps
- Extend notebooks with exercises on recursion and decorators for advanced learners.
- Document unit testing patterns (e.g., `unittest`, `pytest`) to validate function behavior.
